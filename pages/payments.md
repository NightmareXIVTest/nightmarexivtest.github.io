## Pricing
The price depends on several factors, including
- The features of the plugin itself;
- Amount of configurability;
- The complexity of the user interface.

Please note that requesting additional features during or after development may increase the cost, so please describe all the features you want in your plugin to get the most accurate quote possible. 

### Pricing examples
- **A microplugin** that does one or two simple things with little configuration and a simple UI will probably have a minimum price of $60. For example, plugins like ObjectExplorer, Mini or EnemyListHP.
- **A relatively sophisticated plugin** with a modest amount of configuration and a decently complex UI will probably end up in the $200 to $450 range. Plugins like Weatherman, NotificationMaster, HuntTrainAssistant, TextAdvance would land in this price range.
- **Multi-functional, complex plugins** like Lifestream, XIVInstantMessenger or AutoRetainer, as they are now, will easily go well over $500 and will require splitting the development process into several individual steps. Such plugins would be a multi-month commitment not only from the developer's side, but also from the requester's side.

## How to keep the costs down
Here are some important tips and tricks to keep the price of the plugin affordable:
- **Keep the UI simple.** While it may be tempting to ask for a fancy, complex UI, it can easily drive up development costs. Prioritize function over appearance and keep the UI simple - remember, you can always request an upgrade later, after you've used the plugin and decided if it's even necessary.
- **Focus on core functionality first.** It's nice to have extra features right from the start. But many of them may end up being rarely used. Ask for the essentials first, and keep in mind that you can always ask for extra features later, after you have had a chance to use the plugin and figure out what is really necessary.
- **Keep configuration simple.** While a lot of options may allow the plugin to be used by different people in different environments, it can also make the development process longer and more expensive. Again, additional configurability can be added later if needed.
- **Pay with cryptocurrency.** All cryptocurrency payments have automatic 10% discount. 
- **Contact me.** In case nothing works out, we can try to work out an individual offer under individual conditions.

All prices are specified in United States Dollar (USD). If you use another currency, please be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees for your bank and payment system. Please use the <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/" target="_blank">Xe Currenty Converter</a> to find out how much you will have to pay using a different currency.

## Payment plans
I offer the following payment plans:
- **Full upfront.** Best for smaller orders, less than 200 USD. 
- **Split payment.** Best used for large orders that can be divided into several logical steps. When using this payment plan, the cost of a plugin is divided into several parts, one of which must be paid in advance. As the development progresses, I will send you intermediate results and ask you to pay the next part. You will receive the source code of the plugin after the final payment.
- **Payment after development.** Can be combined with split payment and is only available to regular customers. You will receive the source code after the final payment.

{: .important }
I may ask you to delay the payment. It will not affect plugin development time. 

## Notes on individual payment methods
### Cryptocurrency
- If you choose to pay with cryptocurrency, I do not have to pay bank transaction fees, payment system fees and currency conversion fees, therefore I can offer you unconditional 10% discount on all payments; 
- Prefer to use Litecoin to keep transaction costs low, although any popular currency is accepted;
- To calculate how much cryptocurrency you need to send, please use the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/converter/" target="_blank">Coinmarketcap Converter</a> (or just ask before making a payment);
- If you do not already have an account with a crypto exchange, prefer to choose one that is licensed in your country of residence, such as <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/licenses" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/legal/licenses" target="_blank">Binance</a>, <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/where-is-kraken-licensed-or-regulated" target="_blank">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://crypto.com/licenses" target="_blank">Crypto.com</a>.
