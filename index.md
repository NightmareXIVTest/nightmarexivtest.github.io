Welcome to NightmareXIV! I'm happy to announce official launch of plugin commissions. I've been doing them privately here and there, but now everyone can have a plugin made specially for them - and for an affordable price. 

## Why choose NightmareXIV
- Developing plugins since year 2020;
- Extensive amount of plugins has been made (browse here);
- Not a single plugin was decommissioned yet (aside from ones that became pointless);
- Fast updates and dedicated support server.

## How much does it costs? How can I pay for it?
- Minimal price is 100 USD;
- Most of the plugins end up in range of 200 to 400 USD;
- Contact me via Discord if you would like to receive an exact offer;

Read about supported payment methods and on how to keep the cost of the plugin low here.

## How long will it take?
- General rule of thumb - 1 week for each 100 USD evaluated;
- Contact me via Discord if you would like to receive an exact offer with price and time estimate;

Read more on deadlines and possible development pauses here.

## What about updating the plugin? 
- I provide one year of free updates for the plugin in the event it has been broken due to game or Dalamud update. 
- After that, it will be no more than 10% of total plugin costs per update. 
- You may subscribe to Total Nightmare or higher tier on my Patreon for free and prioritized updates.

Read more about plugin update policy here.

## How can I distribute plugin?
You can:
- Distribute plugin publicly;
- Distribute plugin privately to your friends or keep it for yourself;
- Send it to official Dalamud repo or request me to do so;
- Request me to publish it in NightmareXIV repo.

Read more about distribution here.

## Additional free and paid services
Additional free and paid services that you may request together with the plugin are specified on this page. 

## Not a plugin
Besides plugin commissions, I can also offer the following services:
- Development of an arbitrary standalone desktop or server .NET application
- Modification of an existing plugin (if it's license allows it)

Read more about extra services here.

## Commercial use
Normally, you can not use commissioned work commercially. This means:
- Directly or indirectly sell the plugin itself for real money;
- Use the plugin to generate real money income.

However, commercial license is available. Read more about commercial license here.
