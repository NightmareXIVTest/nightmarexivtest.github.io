## Free update period
You will be provided with 1 year of free updates. These updates include:
- Fixing the plugin due to technical game changes;
- Fixing the plugin due to Dalamud or it's dependencies changes.

1 year starts the day after you receive the final plugin version. If, in future, you decide to commission an additional feature for the plugin, this free update period will begin anew starting from the day after you will receive the final plugin version with the commissioned feature completed, even if free update period has expired. Note that bugfixes and updates do not reset free update period.

If your free update period reaches start of the game maintenance, but expires before next maintenance, it is extended until next maintenance begins.

## Free updates exceptions
Free updates will not be provided in the following situations:
- System for which plugin was made received non-technical changes. For example, such as Summoner rework during patch 6.0;
- If you request a plugin for another third party plugin, and that plugin is significantly reworked;
- Commercially licensed plugin, unless a special deal has been made.
