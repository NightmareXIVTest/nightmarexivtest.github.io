- The features of the plugin itself;
- Amount of configurability;
- Complexity of the user interface.

Please note that requesting additional features during or after development may increase the cost, so please describe all the features you want in your plugin to get the most accurate quote possible.

You may not use Patreon as a payment system for plugin commissions. Any custom payments that are made to Patreon will be treated as a voluntary donation.

## Payment schemes
I offer the following payment schemes:
- **Full upfront.** Best used for smaller orders, less than 200 USD. 
- **Split payment.** Best used for large orders that can be divided into several logical steps. When using this payment scheme, the cost of a plugin is divided into several equal parts, one of which must be paid in advance. As the plugin development progresses, I will send you intermediate results and ask you to pay the next part. You will receive the source code for the plugin after the final payment.
- **Post-payment.** Can be combined with split payment and is only available to regular customers. You will receive the source code after the final payment.
