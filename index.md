# NightmareXIV Plugin Commissions
Welcome to NightmareXIV! I'm happy to announce official launch of plugin commissions. I've been doing them privately here and there, but now everyone can have a plugin made specially for them - and for an affordable price. 

## Why choose NightmareXIV
- Developing plugins since year 2020
- Extensive amount of plugins has been made (browse here)
- Not a single plugin was decommissioned yet (aside from ones that became pointless)
- Fast updates and dedicated support server

## How much does it costs? How can I pay for it?
It depends on the plugin, requested functions, configurability and interface. Minimal price is 100 USD, usually it's mini plugins that perform a single function and do not require complex configuration and interface. Usually, most of the plugins end up within 200-400 USD range. Contact me via Discord if you would like to receive an exact offer. Read more on supported payment methods and on how to keep the cost of the plugin low here.

## How long will it take?
General rule of thumb - 1 week for each 100 USD evaluated, it can be faster or slower depending on specific plugin. Contact me via Discord if you would like to receive an exact offer with price and time estimate. Read more on deadlines and possible development pauses here.

## What about updating the plugin? 
I provide one year of free updates (limitations apply) for the plugin in the event it has been broken due to game or Dalamud update. After that, it will be no more than 10% of total plugin costs per update. Additionally, you may subscribe to Total Nightmare or higher tier on my Patreon - as long as you maintain continuous subscription since plugin creation, updates will be free for ALL your commissioned plugin, no matter how many. 

## How can I distribute plugin?
It will be up to you: you can distribute it publicly or privately; you can send it to official Dalamud repo under your name, publish it in an independent repository or keep it for yourself and your friends. Additionally, for some plugins, I can offer publishing it to official Dalamud repo (I do not guarantee that it will be accepted) or NightmareXIV repo. Read more about distribution here.

## Limitations
There will be only one limitation - you can not use commissioned plugin commercially, which means that you can not sell the plugin or access to it for real money or use it in any direct or indirect way to generate real money income. However, if you want to use the plugin commercially - it is possible for an extra pay; read more about commercial use here.
